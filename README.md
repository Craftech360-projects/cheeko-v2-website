# Cheeko — Website (v2)

Marketing site for **Cheeko**, the screen-free, voice-first AI learning toy for Indian children (ages 2–8) by **Altio AI Pvt. Ltd.**

**Live:** https://cheeko-site.netlify.app

## 1. Creative brief

**Product.** Cheeko is a handheld, screen-free toy: a child taps/places a physical RFID card and Cheeko tells a story, plays a rhyme, runs a game, or answers a question out loud. A parent app keeps grown-ups in control. Hero colourway: sunshine yellow (also white + pink). Mascot: an orange, green-eyed fox.

**Audience.** The buyer is the **parent** (25–40, urban/semi-urban India, screen-anxious); the user is the **child** (2–8). The parent makes the purchase decision; the child creates the demand.

**Objective.** Make parents feel Cheeko is a *trustworthy, guilt-free alternative to handing over a phone* — and make the magic obvious in seconds.

**Insight.**
> Parents don't actually fear screens — they fear *passive* attention. They want their child *lost in imagination*, but the one thing that reliably captures the child is a glowing rectangle that **consumes** attention instead of **expanding** it.

**Big idea — "Imagination, out loud."**
Tap a card and a whole world appears — in the child's ears and imagination, never on a screen. The site proves this by *doing* it: as you scroll, you "operate" the product and watch worlds bloom out of the device.

**Tagline.**
- Master (headline): **"Less screen, more childhood."**
- Secondary (product line): *"Imagination, out loud."*

**Art direction — a deliberate dual-register system:**
- **Register A — the real world:** warm, 3D-claymorphic / Pixar-style (child, fox, home, the yellow device).
- **Register B — the imagination:** painterly, cinematic story-worlds (Ghibli/Disney-leaning) for what Cheeko plays — jungle, starry night, curiosity, play.
- **Palette:** orange `#F36E24`, golden `#FFCE00`, fox-rust `#E0823A`, cream `#FFF5E8`, ink `#1B1B1B`. **Type:** Switzer. Warm, rounded, generous whitespace; the one dark moment is "The problem."

## 2. What's been built

A single-page scrolling experience. Top → bottom:

1. **Hero** — "Less screen, more childhood." Headline reveals word-by-word; floating "Story playing / Screen-free" chips; drifting particles; magnetic buttons; 3D-tilt hero image; scroll-progress bar; custom cursor.
2. **Hero → Problem dark takeover** — the hero **pins in place** and a dark circle **grows from the centre over the hero**, revealing **"The problem"** (big image, one line) in place. Then normal scroll resumes. (Scroll-scrubbed, native.)
3. **How it works — the centrepiece (4 cards + features):** one pinned device; each scroll **places a card from a different direction**, the **device screen reveals that world from the centre outward**, and the **whole section background becomes that world**:
   - Stories · Rhymes · Ask Cheeko (safe AI) · Games
   - then a **5th "Made for little hands" beat**: the device zooms in and **hand-drawn orange dotted-arrow labels** point to its parts (fox screen, top card slot, rotary dial, speaker). Mobile shows the labels as a grid.
4. **Proof strip + stats** — scrolling marquee of content types; animated counters (10+ languages, 100+ cards, 0 ads, ages 3–12).
5. **Story gallery** — horizontal-scroll of vertical story-cards (Jungle, Mythology, Bedtime, Rhymes, Languages) + a "+100 more → Get Cheeko" closing card.
6. **Languages** — the regional-language moat (tappable chips).
7. **Safe AI ("Ask Cheeko")** — tutor-not-friend, mic transparency.
8. **For parents + bedtime** — control + the grandmother bedtime moment.
9. **Choose your Cheeko** — colourway switcher (yellow / white / pink), consistent product shots.
10. **CTA** — ₹5,999, confetti on "Get Cheeko." **Footer.**
- Site-wide: **chapter dots** (right rail), background-wash morph, soft warm theming.

**Known TODOs / parked:**
- Exact pixel-match of the world art to the device screen in "How it works" (registration is close; a cleaner masking approach is planned).
- Mobile QA polish pass.
- Final marketing copy + real social proof (ratings/press).
- Custom domain (cheekoai.in) + favicon / OG share image.
- Hero video is a low-res motion test; a premium version is pending.

## 3. Tech & structure

Deliberately **dependency-light** — a single static HTML file, no build step, no framework.

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Markup/Style | Plain HTML + CSS (one `<style>` block) |
| Interactions | **Vanilla JS** — all scroll effects are hand-written `requestAnimationFrame` + scroll listeners, organised as one IIFE per effect |
| Font | Switzer (self-hosted, `assets/fonts/`) |
| External | `canvas-confetti` via CDN (the only third-party script) |
| Hosting | Netlify (static) |

```
site/
├── index.html        # the whole site (CSS top · HTML middle · JS bottom)
├── netlify.toml       # publish config (publish = ".")
├── server.py          # tiny local preview server
├── README.md
└── assets/
    ├── fonts/switzer-variable.ttf
    └── img/           # device renders, fox, painterly worlds, cards, colourways, logo
```

**Why no GSAP/React/Lenis:** a heavy smooth-scroll library broke native scrolling mid-build, so everything was rebuilt on native scroll — fast, robust, and easy for any developer to edit.

## 4. Run locally

```bash
python3 server.py        # serves http://127.0.0.1:8123
# or
python3 -m http.server 8123
```

## 5. Deploy

Static deploy to Netlify (project: `cheeko-site`). Any static host works — just publish this folder.

*Built as a living prototype. Edit `index.html` directly; the JS effects are clearly commented (hero dark takeover · feed sequence · horizontal gallery · etc.).*
